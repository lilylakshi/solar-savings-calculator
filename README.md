# Solar Savings Calculator
A tiny browser extension that calculates how much you save by having Solar electricity in Sri Lanka. Savings are calculated by comparing the bill for utility usage versus the bill you'd get if your solar production had to also come from utility.

The bill is calculated with the formula (version Electricity Tariff Revision 2022) published by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at https://ceb.lk/commercial-tariff/en.
