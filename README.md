# Solar Savings Calculator
A tiny browser extension that calculates how much you save by having Solar electricity in Sri Lanka. Savings are calculated by comparing the bill for utility usage versus the bill you'd get if your solar production had to also come from utility.

This plugin now also comes with an Electricity bill calculator that shows your bill for 2023 tariff revisions and 2022 older tariff revisions.

The bill is calculated with the formula (version Electricity Tariff Revision 2023) published by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at https://ceb.lk/commercial-tariff/en.
